XML View Controller Framework
===============================================================================

The XML View Controller framework (XMVC) is a client side javascript framework
for building rich applications on XML technology.  It's intended for use either
as a web programming framework or within the Mozilla application framework.
The XMVC application was originally developed at Marchex, INC to asist with
development of an internal web service client user interface application.
Given the XML driven nature of SOAP web services the tool worked quite well and
was released under the Mozilla Public License (MPL) under guidence of Scott S.
McCoy (myself).
