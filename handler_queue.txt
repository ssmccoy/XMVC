So when we register an event - we give it a controller.event handler.

This event handler will look up the registered action type for the given event.
If the action type is not yet registered, it will simply place the event into a
queue (array of "events", storing the event object and event type) and when an
event is registered it will then dispatch one instance of the event for every
event in the queue.  This allows events to happen and then asynchronously get
removed.

We have to store the node context


Events in this framework need qualifiers.  We rely on id's and classes for
this.
